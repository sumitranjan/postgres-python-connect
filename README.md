# Python PostgreSQL Database Interaction

This repository contains a Python script for interacting with a PostgreSQL database using the psycopg2 library. The script demonstrates common database operations, including table creation, data insertion, updating records, and deleting records. It serves as a practical example of how to connect and work with a PostgreSQL database in Python.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, make sure you have the following prerequisites installed:

- Python 3.x
- PostgreSQL (with a running server)
- psycopg2 library (you can install it using `pip install psycopg2`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
  `https://github.com/sumitranjan/postgres-python-connect.git`

3. Modify the database connection settings in the script (`host`, `database`, `username`, `password`, `port`) to match your PostgreSQL database configuration.

4. Run the script: `python main.py`

5. The script will perform various database operations, and you will see the results in the console.
